``Project Overview``
This repository contains the project I completed for the Revou Fundamental Course in Software Engineering. The objective was to build a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my understanding of web development fundamentals, including responsive design, styling, and interactivity through JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the code, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!
